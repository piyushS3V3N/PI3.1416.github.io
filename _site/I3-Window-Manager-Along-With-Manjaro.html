  <h2>I3 Window Manager Along With Manjaro</h2>
  <time datetime="2023-01-08T00:00:00+05:30" class="by-line">08 Jan 2023</time>
  <p>So Today I would be sharing my personal experience with i3 window manager in manjaro linux</p>

<p>I know most of us believe Manjaro is a base line arch linux for noobs but on a bright side it has a lot of features which most of us ignore right away like live kernel change or better compatibility with Nvidia and other non-free hardware.</p>

<p>What were the Pr0s:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>First of all the Simplicity it provided. I mean literally what a easy to use setup it is so basically i3wm works on keybindings so there is no menu buttons or extra stuff you want you have to use assigned keys.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It increased the productivity by reducing my time searching through windows it tiles them around so if want a window in floating i will decide rather than cluttering through floating windows.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was fun to customise and honestly i learned a lot while customising it that wouldn’t have been possible in preinstalled gui enviornments.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>What were the c0ns:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Well First it is not something recommended for total newbies (n00bs) as you would be spending most of the time editing rc and config files.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It is somewhat buggy i use i3-gaps fork to get gaps between the window which is not provided by default installation and you might need to install extra items and assign them in your config files.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some cases due to unsupported locales you might not be able to run certain packages which can be fixed by changing locale to supported ones but still i would rather wanna use it in my own locale than some other.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So overall my impression is that it is fun to use this tiling window manager and i would love to see it improve more over the time.</p>

<p>Honestly, I spend hours on forums to get mine setup and all but once it was done it was worth the time indeed.</p>

<p>Mine current setup is :</p>

<ul>
  <li>OS: Manjaro</li>
  <li>Terminal : Termite , URXVT(unicode-rxvt)</li>
  <li>Window Manager : i3-gaps</li>
</ul>
