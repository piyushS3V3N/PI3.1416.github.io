Stack smashing is such a drag to work with look look is it working ? Well, it no longer works unless
and until an idiot decide that they want to disable stack protection. But i wonder how it would behave
under that protection status too? How it would unfold and unravel that malicious data sent to it in buffer
acting as a normal data?

Well who does know
