# Artificial Intelligence For Noobs

The development of computer systems that can do activities that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation, is referred to as artificial intelligence (AI). 

AI systems may be trained on massive volumes of data and utilise algorithms to identify patterns and make predictions or choices.

There are two kinds of AI: narrow AI, which is meant to execute a specific activity, and general AI, which can accomplish any intellectual task that a human can.

Artificial intelligence is being integrated into a variety of industries and applications, including healthcare, banking, customer service, and transportation. It is altering the way we live and work, increasing the efficiency and accuracy of operations, and resolving complicated challenges.

However, the development and application of artificial intelligence presents ethical and societal problems, such as the influence on jobs and privacy. It is critical for society to carefully explore the consequences of AI and to guarantee that it is developed and used responsibly and ethically.

## Main Types of AI
1. ***Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI):*** This sort of AI, sometimes known as weak AI, is meant to execute a single task, such as facial recognition or language translation. ANI systems employ algorithms to spot patterns and make predictions after being trained on massive volumes of data.
2. ***Artificial General Intelligence (AGI):*** This sort of AI is capable of performing every intellectual task that a human is capable of. AGI systems have human-level intelligence and can think, reason, and make decisions in the same way that humans do.
3. ***Artificial Superintelligence (ASI):*** This sort of AI refers to a future situation in which machines outperform human intelligence and can reason and make decisions on their own. ASI is currently mostly a science fiction concept, although some experts believe it could become a reality in the future.

## What Is AI (Technical Terms)
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a subfield of computer science that tries to develop intelligent robots capable of doing activities that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. AI systems may be trained on massive volumes of data and utilise algorithms to identify patterns and make predictions or choices. The goal of AI is to construct systems that can run autonomously or with minimal human participation, and to improve our daily lives by automating complex processes, eliminating human error, and addressing issues that people are unable to handle. AI is classified into two types: narrow AI, which is designed to execute a specific task, and general AI, which can accomplish any intellectual task.
