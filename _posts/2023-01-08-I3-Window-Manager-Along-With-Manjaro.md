title : "I3 Window Manager Along With Manjaro"

So Today I would be sharing my personal experience with i3 window manager in manjaro linux

I know most of us believe Manjaro is a base line arch linux for noobs but on a bright side it has a lot of features which most of us ignore right away like live kernel change or better compatibility with Nvidia and other non-free hardware. 

What were the Pr0s:
* First of all the Simplicity it provided. I mean literally what a easy to use setup it is so basically i3wm works on keybindings so there is no menu buttons or extra stuff you want you have to use assigned keys.

* It increased the productivity by reducing my time searching through windows it tiles them around so if want a window in floating i will decide rather than cluttering through floating windows.

* It was fun to customise and honestly i learned a lot while customising it that wouldn't have been possible in preinstalled gui enviornments.

What were the c0ns:
* Well First it is not something recommended for total newbies (n00bs) as you would be spending most of the time editing rc and config files.

* It is somewhat buggy i use i3-gaps fork to get gaps between the window which is not provided by default installation and you might need to install extra items and assign them in your config files.

* In some cases due to unsupported locales you might not be able to run certain packages which can be fixed by changing locale to supported ones but still i would rather wanna use it in my own locale than some other.

So overall my impression is that it is fun to use this tiling window manager and i would love to see it improve more over the time.

Honestly, I spend hours on forums to get mine setup and all but once it was done it was worth the time indeed.
